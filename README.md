Developed a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related features. The project involved fetching the dataset from an online source, preprocessing the data, training a multiple linear regression model, and evaluating its performance. The final model was capable of predicting insurance costs based on inputs like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The project highlights skills in data handling, model development, and evaluation.
